Classification Problem on Kuzushiji-MNIST with PyTorch

classify the Kuzushiji-MNIST with convolution neural network as base

Also compare with the different scales of learning rate (0.1 and 0.001), batch size (64 and 256), loss function (cross entropy and multi margin loss), and model(including softmax)

Conclusion:
To form a better model, prefer to use:
- CNN
- multi margin loss as loss function
- larger scale of learning rate and batch size
